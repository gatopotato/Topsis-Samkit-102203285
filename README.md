# TOPSIS Implementation Repository

This repository contains an implementation of the **Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)** in Python. The project is divided into multiple files, including the core package, sample data files, and test scripts.

---

## **Repository Structure**

### **1. `Topsis-Samkit-102203285/`**
- This folder contains the Python package for TOPSIS analysis.
- **Files inside this folder:**
  - **`__init__.py`**: Marks this folder as a Python package.
  - **`topsis.py`**: Contains the core logic for performing TOPSIS analysis.
  - **`README.md`**: The package-specific README explaining how to use the package.

### **2. `102203285-data.xlsx`**
- **Purpose**: Input file containing sample data for TOPSIS analysis.
- **Details**:
  - The first column represents the alternatives (e.g., `M1`, `M2`, etc.).
  - Remaining columns represent the decision matrix with numeric values.

### **3. `102203285-output.xlsx`**
- **Purpose**: The output file generated by the TOPSIS program.
- **Details**:
  - Includes all columns from the input file.
  - Additional columns:
    - **`Topsis Score`**: The calculated score for each alternative.
    - **`Rank`**: The ranking of each alternative based on the TOPSIS score.

### **4. `102203285.py`**
- **Purpose**: The command-line implementation of TOPSIS.
- **How to Run**:
  ```bash
  python 102203285.py <input_file> <weights> <impacts> <output_file>
  ```
- Replace <weights> with the weights for each criterion, separated by commas (e.g., 1,1,1,2).
- Replace <impacts> with the impacts for each criterion, separated by commas (e.g., +,+,-,+ where + is for benefit criteria and - is for cost criteria).
- Replace <output_file> with the desired name for the output file (e.g., 102203285-output.xlsx).

### **5. `test.py`**
- **Purpose**: A test script to validate the functionality of the `Topsis-Samkit-102203285` package.
- **Details**:
  - Imports the `topsis` module from the package.
  - Runs a sample test using the input data (`102203285-data.xlsx`) and generates the output file.
  - Verifies that the `Topsis` module correctly calculates the scores and rankings.
